# Retros Against Humanity

Say goodbye to boring Agile retrospectives and hello to "**[Retros Against Humanity](https://muchzill4.github.io/retros-against-humanity/)**"!

Based on the hilarious game Cards Against Humanity, this innovative meeting format uses fill-in-the-blank prompts to encourage your team to think outside the box. You'll explore what worked, what didn't, and what you can do better moving forward - all while having a blast!

So, grab some post-its and get ready for a fun and engaging retrospective like never before.
